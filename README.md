# Mega Project List of 
# Machine Learning/Artifical Intelligence Project Ideas
A list of practical Machine Learning or AI projects that anyone can solve in any programming language. 


A list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language. These projects are divided in multiple categories, same problem may appear in more than one categories. 

To get started, simply fork this repo.

Problems are motivated by the ones shared at:

* [CMU Machine Learning Class](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./10701/projects.html)

## Table of Contents

- [Text](https://github.com/NirantK/awesome-project-ideas#text) - include NLP tasks here for now
- [Vision](https://github.com/NirantK/awesome-project-ideas#vision) - includes image and video processing
- [Forecasting](https://github.com/NirantK/awesome-project-ideas#forecasting) - mostly Time Series and similar forecasting challenges
- [Recommender Systems](https://github.com/NirantK/awesome-project-ideas#recommender-systems)

Text
---------
**Can you classify the text of an e-mail message to decide who sent it?** The Enron E-mail data set contains about 500,000 e-mails from about 150 users. The data set is available here: Enron Data

**Sentiment Analysis**

Vision
---------

**Image Classification/Object Recognition** - Classify/tag images from a dataset such as CIFAR-10, [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) or [MS Coco](http://mscoco.org/) into classes such as dog, cat, horse.

You can try to create an object recognition system which can identify which object category is the best match for a given test image.
Apply clustering to learn object categories without supervision

**Character recognition** (digits) is the good old Optical Character Recognition problem. [Stanford dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~btaskar/ocr/) might be a good starting point. 

Forecasting
---------
**Weather prediction** Learn a probabilistic model to predict rain levels. [45 years of daily precipitation data from the Northwest of the US](http://research.jisao.washington.edu/data_sets/widmann/) for getting started. 


Recommender Systems
---------
**Movie Recommender** **Can you predict the rating a user will give on a movie?** Do this using the movies that user has rated in the past, as well as the ratings similar users have given similar movies. The data is available here: [Netflix Prize](http://www.netflixprize.com/)

## FAQ
1. **Can I use the ideas here for my thesis?** Yeah, totally. I'd love to know how it went. 

2. **Do you want to share my solution/code to a problem here**? Yeah, sure - why not? Go to [Github issues](https://github.com/NirantK/awesome-project-ideas/issues) in the repository and let me know there. 

3. **How can I add my ideas here?** Just send a pull request and we'll discuss? 

4. **Hey @NirantK, something is wrong here!** Yikes, I am sorry. Please tell me by raising a [Github issue](https://github.com/NirantK/awesome-project-ideas/issues). I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.
